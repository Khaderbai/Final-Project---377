For my project, originally I was intending on creating a lyrics API website that returned the most common words in certain songs by artists. I was hoping to then use this data, keyed with the genre of music that it came from to create a word cloud visualization of the most common words in particular music genres. The genre would be filterable by the user to whatever they type in the input field and the interface would return a cloud model of the most common words, ignoring stop words. I tried a variety of APIs and tried to implement each to make it work, however my biggest obstacle was the fact that there no lyrics returning APIs on the internet that support CORS. Without Node or bypassing CORS somehow, I could not get data returned.
  The APIs that I tried vary from:
  https://developer.musixmatch.com/
  https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#
  https://docs.genius.com/
  https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
  
Unforunately, none of these worked and I could not implement the documentation correctly.

  I decided to try and map sewer overflows throughout Maryland to give better information and insight into certain sewer lines and plumbing systems in the area that are in bad condition or falling apart. This can also indicate a lack of maintanence by the county due to clogging drains cuasing the overflow. I tried to revert back to a website similar to the labs that loaded the data and then was able to generate a random list, as well as filter them based on a user inputted text field. I set up the buttons and implemented the functions to make them work however to no avail. I get data to load and a few markers to place but besides that it is dysfunctional.
